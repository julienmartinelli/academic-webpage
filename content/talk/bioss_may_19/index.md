abstract: "We consider mechanistic models based on Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN)
with their continuous dynamics based on ordinary differential equations,
and finite time series about the time evolution of concentration of molecular species
for a given time horizon and a finite set of perturbed initial conditions. We present a greedy heuristics
unsupervised statistical learning algorithm to infer reactions. We evaluate this algorithm both on
simulated data from hidden CRNs, and on real videomicroscopy single
cell data about the circadian clock and cell cycle progression of NIH3T3
embryonic fibroblasts."
