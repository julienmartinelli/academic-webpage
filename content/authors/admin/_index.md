I am a PhD student at Inria/Inserm, working under supervision of [François Fages](http://lifeware.inria.fr/wiki/Fages/HomePage) and [Annabelle Ballesta](http://annabelle.ballesta.fr/)

* Research: My PhD tackles the predicament of learning **Mechanistic Models** from time-series data. While the traditional approach in Systems Biology assumes a model and uses the available data to calibrate its parameters, our aim here is
to develop new **Machine Learning** techniques in order to directly learn both the model and its parameters from the observations. We focus on medical applications such as **Cancer's Chronotherapy.**

* Teaching:
    * 2019-2021: Teaching Assistant • 2nd year BSC • Université de Paris
        * Real Analysis (42h)
        * Multivariate Functions (18h)
    * 2018-2019: Teaching Assistant • 1st year BSC • Université de Paris
        * Mathematics and Calculus (60h)
