## __Biography__

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Aalto University, in the [Probabilistic
Machine Learning](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) group, working with
[Samuel Kaski](https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski), [Vikas Garg](https://www.mit.edu/~vgarg/) and [Markus Heinonen](https://users.aalto.fi/~heinom10/).
Our goal is to integrate human feedback into machine learning algorithms, with an emphasis on __*de novo* Drug Design__ applications.

Prior to that thesis was conducted at Inria/Institut Curie, under supervision of [François Fages](http://lifeware.inria.fr/wiki/Fages/HomePage) and [Annabelle Ballesta](http://annabelle.ballesta.fr/). We developed methods at the boundary of __Systems Biology__ and __Machine Learning__ to infer mechanistic models from time series data. A major contribution of the manuscript was to apply such methods to investigate the impact of systemic regulators (e.g. temperature, nutrient exposure, hormones) on the cellular circadian clock, in an attempt to __personalize
Cancer Chronotherapies__. The manuscript can be
found [here](https://www.theses.fr/2022IPPAX011) and the slides [here](files/defense.pdf).
