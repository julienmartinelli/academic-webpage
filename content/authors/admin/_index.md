I am a postdoctoral researcher at Aalto University, in the [Probabilistic
Machine Learning](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) group, supervised by
[Samuel Kaski](https://people.aalto.fi/samuel.kaski). My work focuses on
integrating human feedback into machine learning algorithms.

I successfully defended my PhD on February 18th, 2022. The manuscript can be
found [here](files/manuscrit.pdf) and the slides [here](files/defense.pdf).

My thesis was conducted at Inria/Institut Curie, under supervision of [François Fages](http://lifeware.inria.fr/wiki/Fages/HomePage) and [Annabelle Ballesta](http://annabelle.ballesta.fr/). We developed methods at the boundary of __Systems Biology__ and __Machine Learning__ to infer mechanistic models from time series data. A major contribution of the manuscript was to apply such methods to investigate the impact of systemic regulators (e.g. temperature, nutrient exposure, hormones) on the cellular circadian clock, in an attempt to __personalize
Cancer Chronotherapies__.
